The project is about finding the top 15 important words that 
characterises the book. 

The additional question is which keyword is associated 
with the highest ratings.

The books are from the top 100 books from a list created by the 
Guardians, and for the summaries I used goodreads.

The project outline is as follows:

1. Create a nested dictinoary which links the book title to every
data we need later on e.g. author, url, summary, rating etc.

2. Scrape the Guardian's website for the list of top 100 books

3. Since goodreads have a unique id for each book, we need to 
scrape the search page for the book to find the book's unqiue entry.
For this, we first scrape the searchpage which has a consistent 
url format which I can easily create with a for-loop.

4. Scrape the html of the search_result page to get the url of the book,

5. Scrape the goodreads html for summaries and ratings
of the book with the given url.

6. Use spacy to toeknize the summaries

7. Calculate tf-idf scores and store them in the big nested dictionary.

8. Consolidate all data and plot the answers to our research questions.
